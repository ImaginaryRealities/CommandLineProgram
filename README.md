Command Line Program Framework
==============================
This project contains the source code for the ImaginaryRealities Command Line Program Framework. The Command Line Program Framework is an application framework that is designed to make it easier to build applications that are executed from the command line and accept options and positional arguments or that operate on files. The framework also helps with building command suite programs similar to Git and building Windows services that are easy to debug and maintain.
